I can't scroll to click done shopping, make sure all modes allow players to see bottom elements

I can't click into text box to name my recipe or click on pastry type dropdown, also there are so many white text over white area in pre op buildings and baking stage

in recipe book, i can click ingredients but can't name or change pastry type. also the topping ingredients 
amount when I click on them I can't change, but basisc ingredients yes
reason i can't change pastry type or name is a gsap animation I'm able to tilt the book when I drag.
also all ingredients amount in recipe book are unchangeable but clickable

in pre-op phase, all helpful tips text or informational text, check metro reality, and buisness advice, and change all inside buildings background area to dynamic dark colors 

My game currently has very little financial education value, when teens play my game,
I want them to learn about the financial world behind running a business, including
the technical terms of setting up a business, so when they start their own business someday,
they practically know what to expect, what type of numbers to expect, know what and how of the legal side of buisness,
and know how to manage their money and assets effectively, what decisions a buisness owner has to make. Plan out
how to integrate really useful info from top finance books, blogs, reputable websites about
money management, business management, and business strategy, legal details of buisness, etc...
Make sure to not use too many AI token credits as I have limited. Focus the tokens on implementing actual changes to the plan.
Try not to get stuck debugging, don't open a browser to test the game, I'll do the debugging.
