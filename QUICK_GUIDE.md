## Economic Simulation

### What is it?
A realistic market simulation that makes ingredient prices and customer demand change over time, just like in the real world.

### Key Concepts:

#### Inflation
- Prices generally trend upward over time
- Currently around 3% annual average
- Can swing between -2% (deflation) to +8% (high inflation)
- Affects ALL ingredient prices

#### Supply & Demand
**Supply** (how much is available):
- High supply = Lower prices
- Low supply = Higher prices
- Categories: Grains, Dairy, Produce

**Demand** (how much people want):
- High demand = Higher prices
- Low demand = Lower prices

#### Seasonal Effects
- **Spring**: More produce available
- **Summer**: High dairy demand, lots of produce
- **Fall**: Good grain harvest
- **Winter**: Less produce, higher dairy demand

#### Economic Events
Random events that can happen (5% chance per day):
- **Flour Shortage** - Grain prices spike
- **Dairy Surplus** - Dairy products cheaper
- **Sugar Price Spike** - Sweeteners cost more
- **Wheat Harvest** - Grains cheaper
- And more...

Events last **3-14 days** and are shown in the dashboard.

### Strategy Tips:

#### Buying Strategy:
1. **Check the dashboard** before buying ingredients
2. **Stock up** when prices are low (green indicators)
3. **Buy in bulk** to get discounts
4. **Watch for events** - dairy surplus? Buy lots of butter!
5. **Plan ahead** - don't wait until you're out

#### Seasonal Strategy:
- **Summer**: Buy lots of produce (berries, fruits) - it's cheap!
- **Winter**: Focus on grain-based products, produce is expensive
- **Fall**: Stock up on flour after harvest
- **Spring**: Transition period, good for planning

#### Risk Management:
- **Don't overbuy** - ingredients spoil
- **Diversify** - don't rely on one type of product
- **Keep cash reserves** - for when all prices are high
- **Watch inflation** - if it's rising, ingredient costs will keep increasing

#### Pricing Strategy:
- **Quality products** = Can charge more
- **Budget customers** = Need lower prices
- **Premium customers** = Willing to pay for quality
- **Match price to quality** and customer segment
