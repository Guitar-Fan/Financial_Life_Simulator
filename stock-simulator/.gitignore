Ported a Vue.js version of Sweet Success Bakery for robust backend and UX.
-Vue.js offer several benefits over Vanilla js;
1) Vue.js excels in backend, with automatic DOM updates.
2) Modular UX building
3) Reliable data storing

Reactive State Management: Vue's reactivity system automatically updates the UI (e.g., player health, scores, inventory) when the underlying data changes, eliminating manual DOM manipulation required in vanilla JS.
Component-Based Structure: Game elements (menus, inventory slots, player stats) can be built as reusable, modular Single File Components (SFCs), which makes code easier to organize and maintain.
Faster UI Development: Vue allows for quicker development of game interfaces, with built-in tools for handling complex interactivity compared to building everything from scratch in vanilla JavaScript.
Performance: Vue is highly optimized, using a virtual DOM to ensure that updates are efficient, which is crucial for maintaining a smooth user experience in games.
Ecosystem and Tools: Vue has a strong ecosystem, including Vite for fast build times, and integrates well with tools for state management, which helps in managing complex game states.
