Redesign game play to allow player to walk to the mode they want. 

This game now has functional gameplay. There are 4 modes; buy inventory, produce goods, sell pastries
and summary/review stats. Only have basic financial stats, such as net loss and profit. Had AI generate
a bunch of bakery recipes, ingredients, customers and used emojis as pictures for everything. Will transition
to free-roaming architecture instead of forced mode change. Future updates will introduce a more immersive environment, allowing players to explore the bakery, interact
with equipment, and manage staff and resources visually. The UI and graphics will be enhanced with SVG, GSAP,
or Phaser for a richer experience. The tutorial will guide new players step-by-step, showing optimal actions
through interactive bubbles and dialogue, making it easier to learn the game mechanics and strategies.

the wasd keys don't work for navigating pre operational map and the graphics
are too basic around

make objects have basic shapes don't

when pre operational play is done, and player presses open bakery, play area
 turns blank without giving errors, pls comeplete the transition to free-roaming architecture

make a version md, telling the details of each major update

make a plan md, giving suggestions on how game could be developed to 
simulate more dynamic, realistic financial factors, and teach more business
concepts, and be more interactive and fun

A series of games aiming to simulate realistic scenarios’ aspects of finance, 
such as the money management behind small businesses, using real finance concepts and realistic stats.
Financial principles demonstrated in game are based on well-known finance books, such as Rich Dad Poor Dad.
Main game is a small bakery business simulation so teens can learn what’s behind starting a business.

implement improvement 1 more obviously,include detailed charts in a dedicated menu chart
items showing the finish

upgrade the pre operational phase to be way more complicated and can be considered close to real world with more options, parameters for locations,
 variability and complex decision making, better scene details

now with the advanced pre-operation phase, code the other stages continuing with the pre-op 
features and logic so the whole game is unified in functionality and 
features. Also players may get lost in map, so have animated arrow that point to place
player is supposed to go. Also implement improvement 1 from plan.md more obviously, include detailed charts 
in a dedicated menu item that shows in game financial trends (tax, inflation, supply, )
factors that can lower or increase price) and also tracks player's business financial stats

pre op phase is good, but as soon as player moves to buy inventory,
page is blank, dedicated finance tracking item in menu opens, but doesn't show
anything. errors in eruda:

charts on finance trends menu item keep expanding and show nothing, the time bakery
items take irl is too long make it last like 2 secs, put back time speed multipliers
also allow 4 times the amount of food items that can go into oven at once, (this is a game, some
parts need to be sped up). Allow for users to bake while selling to customers.

implement number 5 on plan.md: inventory and spoilage system. There is already
some spoilage and inventory logic, but upgrade it significantly according to plan.md

Could you add some sound effects to bakery game using howler.js

Allow user to skip pre op phase using default standard settings of a normal bakery.

When user is done with pre-op phase, show open bakery button on right side of map,
so user doesn't have to walk to it. Also Quick start mode doesn't work, make
sure features and functionality are consistant in quick start mode: TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'find')

code gameplay to demonstrate the finance concept of "assets vs liabilities".
at certain key moments of gameplay where a certain thing happens, or a user does
something, it unlocks a financial "insight", similar to an achievement in other games
where a in game nofication pops up and you unlocked a piece of financial wisdom in
finance wisdom panel (name it something shorter, but similar vibes).

Upgrade baking and selling phase to include autonomous employee function,
with a dedicated part of screen for employees. Also upgrade baking and selling
phase to be more complex and realistic in general (e.g. baking isn't just shoving
ingredients in oven, chefs need to prepare it, takes time and expertise, preparation impacts
quality)

Make employees have faces. Also after hiring employees, the dialog box that
says i hired won't disappear and players can't continue

delete quick start mode, but in pre-op mode, have a button to for user put in "default"
options of every building, so the game treats it like the user entered it themselves, but
the computer actually did. that way, everything is uniform, and less error prone.

Transition the game architecture to make the labor part of game autonomous, such as buying
inventory, baking and selling. Player is a business owner, not a self-employed baker. 
Users can learn more about finance without having to do the actual labor.
This game is meant to be a finance simulator, not a bakery simulator. Player will have to
choose effective strategies and make unique, choices on how the bakery should run.
Develop the plan to make the game less labor, more learning about finance, while
still mostly about fun.
do not use antigravity remote browser to check errors, only use error checking tools
like syntax check. I'll handle to player level problems. Also I prefer you to create little
edits at a time, not massive changes, unless absolutely necessary.

make sure the architecture really has a lot of complexity in the beginning phase, as it is vital for
a successful business to have the right direction and work philosophy from the start.
So include a lot of complex and realistic multiple choice decisions that could involve
sliding parameters to control certain aspects of the business, and actual popups 
decisions.

don't look at AI decisions, use my own logic. then

now there are no console errors, but the start and how to play button doesn't work,
don't spend a lot of time checking errors except for checking syntax errors, I'll
check javascript console.
